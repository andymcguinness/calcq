# calcq

A small calculator app built with AngularJS, drum 'n' bass, and Diet Coke.

## Why?

A simple calculator is less cliche than a to-do list app, but it still poses some fun, interesting logic challenges.

## What's in it?

- Diet Coke x 4 cans
- AngularJS x 1 app
- Terra Chips x 1 bag
- Annie's Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks x 1 bag
- Drum 'n' Bass x 2 premade Spotify playlists
- CSS Reset x 1 file
- Normalize.css x 1 file
